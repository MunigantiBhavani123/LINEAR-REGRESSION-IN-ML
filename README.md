# LINEAR-REGRESSION-IN-ML
THIS IS THE FILE OF LLINEAR REGRESSION NOTES WHICH HAVE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS AND ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES
## BASIC ASSUMPTIONS OF LINEAR REGRESSION
There are four assumptions associated with a linear regression model
1.LINEARITY: The Relation between X and the mean of Y is linear.
2.HOMOSCEDASTICITY: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.
3.INDEPENDENCE: Observations are independent of each other.
4.NORMALITY: For any fixed value of X,Y is normally distributed.
## ADVANTAGES:
1.Linear regression performs exceptionally well for linearly separable data
2.Easy to implement and train the model
3.It can handle overfitting using dimensionality reduction techniques and cross validation and regularization
##DISADVANTAGES:
1.Sometimes lot of feature engineering is required
2.If the independent feature are correlated it may effect performance
3.It is often quite prone to noise and overfitting
